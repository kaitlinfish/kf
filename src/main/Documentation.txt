QuickClick is a 3rd party reservation service provided through a web application. The purpose is for the user to be able to book flights 
and hotel rooms through one website, saving the user time instead of going through multiple websites to book a room or website.

When the user first enters QuickClip, they will be directed to the home page(index.html), 
where the user will have the option to book a hotel room or book a flight. 

If the user chooses to book a flight, They will click the "book a flight" button, which will direct them to a page where the user
can choose what type of flight class they'd like to travel in, and how many seats they will need(addFlight.html). Once the user 
is satisfied with their input, they will press the submit button. 

The submit button will then direct them to a page that will display what the user entered(flightBookings.html). There will be two
button links where the user can either book another flight(addFlight.html) or return to the homepage(index.html).

If the user chooses to book another flight, the web application will direct them back to the add flight page, restarting the add flight 
page. 

Back to the homepage. If the user chose to book a room reservation, the user would click the "Make a hotel reservation page" button, 
which would direct the user to a page where the user can choose what room type they would like to book and the number of guests that 
will be staying with them(addHotel.html). Once the user is satisfied with what they've entered, the user will press the submit button.

The submit button will take the user to a page that will display what the user entered(hotelBookings.html). There will be two button 
links where the user can either book another room(addHotel.html) or return to the homepage(index.html).


If the user chooses to book another room, the web application will direct them back to the add hotel page, restarting the add hotel 
page.
